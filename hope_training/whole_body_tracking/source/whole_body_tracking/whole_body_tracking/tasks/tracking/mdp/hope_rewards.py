"""HOPE goal-tracking reward terms (HITTER r_goal).

These implement the racket/base target tracking rewards on top of the BeyondMimic imitation
reward (``r_imitation``, the ``motion_*`` terms already in ``rewards.py``) and the regularization
reward (``r_regularization``, ``action_rate_l2`` / ``joint_torques_l2`` / contact penalties).

Activation timing follows HITTER: the base-position reward is active **before** the strike; the
racket position/velocity/normal rewards are active only in a **short window around** the strike.
Because a ``RewardTermCfg`` weight is constant, the time gating is applied *inside* each term by
multiplying the exponential kernel by the command's ``pre_strike`` / ``strike_window`` mask.

The exponential kernel form (``exp(-error/std**2)``) mirrors the BeyondMimic motion-tracking
rewards. HITTER does not publish reward weights or kernel forms, so the weights in the env config
are HOPE choices to be tuned, not paper-sourced values.
