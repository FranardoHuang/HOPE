# G05 Isaac Training First Loop

Status: Partial

## Goal

Run the first end-to-end Isaac training loop that produces a policy artifact, even if the policy is weak.

This gate should prove that the training stack can consume A3 assets and produce a deployable policy format.

## Inputs

- Isaac-ready A3 asset from G04.
- Motion references or placeholder task references.
- BeyondMimic/whole-body tracking scaffold.
- Policy observation/action contract.

## Outputs

- First accepted training run.
- Training config.
- Logs and metrics.
- Exported policy artifact path or metadata.
- Initial policy evaluation notes.

## Related Directories

- `hope_training/whole_body_tracking`
- `docs/interfaces/policy_observation_action.md`
- `docs/operations/run_training.md`
- `vendor_assets/` for generated heavy policy artifacts if needed
- `external_repos/TTRL-ICRA2026` as an auto-synced reference if first-loop failures need comparison

## Operation Docs

- [../operations/run_training.md](../operations/run_training.md)
- [../operations/setup_local_sync.md](../operations/setup_local_sync.md)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Isaac environment starts with the A3 asset.
- A random rollout works.
- A first PPO or equivalent training loop runs.
- Policy export path is documented.
- First-loop results are recorded, even if poor.

## Current State

Follow-up note (2026-07-02/03, after the simtoreal2 merge):

- The training default is now `task=HOPEPingPongDeployParity` (`cfg/train.yaml`;
  `HOPEPingPongRealSensor` is a backward-compat alias): the 175-D deploy-parity actor contract
  (see [../interfaces/policy_observation_action.md](../interfaces/policy_observation_action.md)),
  base-free footwork rewards (`base_position` removed; dense `racket_progress` + pre-strike
  slip/twist/upright penalties + `arm_torque_saturation`), per-clip blade-centered 3-D target
  pos/vel boxes, `strike_phase_per_clip: [0.47, 0.333]` on the re-grounded `_hopex` (v3) clips,
  `racket_velocity_std: 1.0` (plan 1.0 → 0.8 → 0.5), and PD-gain DR re-enabled at ±15%
  (2026-07-02 sim2real fine-tune; documented HITTER departure). The 180-D `task=HOPEPingPong` is a
  legacy comparison path and is not deploy-honest.
- This path produced the first hardware-deployed policy: `model_p4_deployparity.onnx` (175-D /
  31-act), sim2sim-validated in MuJoCo and run on the real A3 on 2026-07-02 (forehand only). The
  newest lineage is the explicit-clipped-PD fine-tune (`launch_explicitpd_ft.sh`, model_25700).
  Contract checks: `hope_isaac_py scripts/verify_realsensor.py --check layout|rollout|onnx`.
- Exact accepted run IDs/metrics for a quality baseline are still pending (see Not done).

Follow-up note (2026-07-01, `main` after the unified HITTER audit — values superseded above):

- The active `HOPEPingPong` config then defaulted to unified forehand+backhand training (`registry_name_2` enabled), `target_mode: uniform`, fixed strike plane `x=0.4`, `strike_phase_per_clip: [0.36, 0.74]` (v1 clips), actor `swing_type`, and no actor `racket_target_normal_w`.
- The `registry_for_runner` blocker and local-motion regression found during the audit were fixed in the training entry: local `motion_file=<forehand.npz> motion_file_2=<backhand.npz>` now bypasses WandB, while registry-backed runs still link the used registry artifact(s).
- The 2026-06-26 first-loop result remains useful as pipeline history, but the unified HOPEPingPong path still needs a fresh Isaac run before it can count as an accepted baseline.

Done:

- Training scaffold is present under `hope_training/whole_body_tracking`.
- Existing docs describe BeyondMimic-style training assumptions.
- The branch adds Hydra training/eval entrypoints, HOPEPingPong task config, racket-target command logic, and A3-specific robot config.
- `reimplement.md` records that `TrackingFlat` and `HOPEPingPong` forehand training have run end-to-end on the copied A3 URDF asset, including wandb logging, checkpoint save, and `policy.onnx` export.
- Commit `42489cd` adds `setup_train_env.sh`, richer WandB/live metrics, and in-container ONNX export support.
- Earlier `reference_perturbed` / PATH B-C experiments (commit `c951d9d`) are present in history, but the current default is the 2026-07-01 unified HITTER path: direct uniform target sampling, no success-gated perturbation curriculum, and no `ref_vel_scale` ramp. `reference_perturbed` remains available as a non-default `target_mode` and now uses per-clip reference strike centers.
- `RacketTargetCommand` logs conditional exact-strike pass rates: `strike_pos_pass_exact`, `strike_vel_pass_exact`, `strike_normal_pass_exact`, `strike_composite_success_exact`, and `exact_strike_sample_count_decayed`.
- `RacketTargetCommand` also supports optional debug reward logging (`debug_reward_logging`) for swing-through sign checks and raw-vs-gated reward kernels. Keep it off for production runs unless diagnosing reward scale.
- The HOPE actor observation includes `swing_type` and desired runtime targets, but not `racket_target_normal_w`; racket pose/velocity/normal remain critic/reward-only simulation state.
- `scripts/train.py` logs import provenance, env-cfg source, every applied task override, and post-override racket knobs; YAML keys that target missing env-cfg attributes raise instead of silently no-oping.
- `scripts/train.py` keeps registry defaults available from `cfg/task/*.yaml`, while `motion_file=<local.npz>` and optional `motion_file_2=<local.npz>` take precedence for no-WandB smoke tests or locally generated references.
- Local unified-policy training can use Step 9-12 video-generated motions directly with `motion_file=../motions/preprocessed/hope_forehand.npz motion_file_2=../motions/preprocessed/hope_backhand.npz logger=tensorboard`.
- Generated ONNX policy artifacts remain ignored by asset policy unless a gate records an external artifact path.
- Merged from `train_1` (2026-06-26) and superseded by the unified HITTER alignment: paddle-contact timing is per clip, expressed as `strike_phase_per_clip` (then `[0.36, 0.74]` on v1 clips; current default `[0.47, 0.333]` on the `_hopex` v3 clips); `episode_length_s: 3.0` caps each episode to about one swing; `scripts/train.py` / `cfg/train.yaml` keep the `checkpoint_path` knob for staged resume.
- 2026-07-02: `HOPEPingPong.yaml` and `HOPEPingPongRealSensor.yaml` were synchronized for unified forehand+backhand training. Old single-swing wording and old backhand positive-y/high-z coordinate notes were removed from the YAML comments; both observation-route candidates now point at the same re-grounded target boxes.
- 2026-07-02: Clip wrap no longer performs mid-episode RSI for HOPE ping-pong (`motion.rsi_on_wrap: false` in both task YAMLs; the knob was renamed to main's equivalent `motion.wrap_teleport` on 2026-07-03). Episode reset still initializes from the reference, but wrap only advances the reference clip/time and target, forcing the policy to learn physical between-swing recovery.
- 2026-07-02: `racket_progress` now resets its previous-distance baseline and emits zero on motion/target resample steps, removing the fixed wrap/reset reward spike from the base-free footwork signal.
- 2026-07-02: `HOPEPingPong` and `HOPEPingPongRealSensor` were switched to `racket.target_mode: reference_perturbed`: the initial target center is the imitated clip's own strike-frame racket FK state, and the long-run distribution widens through success-gated perturbations (`ref_perturb_pos=[0.15,0.20,0.15]`, `ref_perturb_vel=[1.0,1.0,0.8]`). [Pre-merge branch configuration: after merging main's unified HITTER redesign, the default is `target_mode: uniform` with a fixed strike plane; `reference_perturbed` and these perturbation ranges remain available as a non-default option.]
- 2026-07-02: The shared RunPod now has an independent `hope-motion-py310` Conda env for GVHMR/GMR motion preparation, separate from Isaac Lab. GVHMR/GMR import checks pass on RTX 5090 with PyTorch `2.7.0+cu128`; PyTorch3D `0.7.9` was built from source for `sm_120`; GVHMR non-body checkpoints are present; and the local ignored GMR clone has verified `agibot_a3` MJCF/IK registration with 31 hinge joints matching `joint_order_agibot_a3.yaml`.
- 2026-07-02: Uploaded forehand/backhand MP4s were converted through GVHMR -> GMR -> `scripts/csv_to_npz.py` into local ignored motions: `hope_training/motions/preprocessed/hope_forehand.npz` (`joint_pos=(139,31)`, `body_pos_w=(139,32,3)`, `fps=50`) and `hope_training/motions/preprocessed/hope_backhand.npz` (`joint_pos=(132,31)`, `body_pos_w=(132,32,3)`, `fps=50`).
- 2026-07-02: WandB setup is verified for `WANDB_ENTITY=BerkeleyPingPong`, `WANDB_REGISTRY_ORG=dongc_1-university-of-california-berkeley-org`, `WANDB_PROJECT=hope_wbc`, and `WANDB_MOTION_PROJECT=csv_to_npz`. The registry aliases `dongc_1-university-of-california-berkeley-org/wandb-registry-motions/hope_forehand:latest` and `.../hope_backhand:latest` resolve to `BerkeleyPingPong/csv_to_npz/hope_forehand:v4` and `BerkeleyPingPong/csv_to_npz/hope_backhand:v4`; both contain `motion.npz`.
- 2026-07-02: Registry-backed `HOPEPingPong` WandB smoke passed with `source setup_train_env.sh && hope_isaac_py scripts/train.py task=HOPEPingPong algo=ppo headless=true num_envs=32 max_iterations=1 logger=wandb run_name=smoke_registry_wandb_finish`. W&B run `6xus13ga` finished at https://wandb.ai/BerkeleyPingPong/hope_wbc/runs/6xus13ga, used both motion artifacts, and synced `model_0.pt`, `2026-07-02_11-56-04_smoke_registry_wandb_finish.onnx`, config, diff, output log, and summary. Local outputs are under `hope_training/whole_body_tracking/logs/rsl_rl/agibot_a3_hope/2026-07-02_11-56-04_smoke_registry_wandb_finish/`.
- 2026-07-02: The same registry `hope_forehand/backhand:v4` artifacts used for the smoke were later verified as directionally wrong for real training: frame-0 pelvis yaw is 82.03/85.92 deg and strike velocity is +Y-dominant. Corrected local ignored clips were generated at `hope_training/motions/preprocessed/hope_forehand_hopex.npz` and `hope_backhand_hopex.npz`. [Pre-merge, both task YAMLs defaulted to these local files; post-merge the YAMLs default to the WandB registry aliases again — pass `motion_file=`/`motion_file_2=` to train on the corrected `_hopex` clips until corrected v5+ registry artifacts are uploaded.]
- 2026-07-02: `scripts/csv_to_npz.py --robot agibot_a3` now auto-aligns exported world-frame arrays into HOPE +X before saving/uploading, and `scripts/check_motion_target_alignment.py` provides a no-Isaac gate. Verification: `python -m py_compile ...` passed; `python scripts/check_motion_target_alignment.py --yaml cfg/task/HOPEPingPong.yaml` and `--yaml cfg/task/HOPEPingPongRealSensor.yaml` passed; the same check fails on old v4 as expected.
- 2026-07-02 (later): Fixed an `UnboundLocalError` in `RacketTargetCommand._resample_command` (`hope_commands.py`; the base-XY coupling branch read `motion` before assignment) that crashed EVERY `HOPEPingPong*` env reset — the working tree could not start training at all until this fix. After the fix: local-clip smoke passed (`num_envs=32 max_iterations=2 logger=tensorboard`), and a bounded verification training run passed: `hope_isaac_py scripts/train.py task=HOPEPingPong algo=ppo headless=true num_envs=4096 max_iterations=300 run_name=e2e_verify_train seed=1` -> W&B run `wuj6ds9u` (https://wandb.ai/BerkeleyPingPong/hope_wbc/runs/wuj6ds9u), mean reward -1.37 -> ~25, mean episode length 5 -> ~340 steps, `strike_success` 0 -> 0.006 in 300 iters, `model_{0,100,200,299}.pt` + ONNX exported and synced. Pipeline viability evidence on the corrected `_hopex` clips, still not a quality baseline. [This run used the pre-merge branch defaults, i.e. `target_mode: reference_perturbed`.]
- 2026-07-02 (later): Full fresh MP4 -> npz rerun in an isolated dir reproduces the shipped artifacts bit-for-bit (GMR pkl and retargeted CSV byte-identical; npz equal to `hope_forehand_hopex.npz` within 2e-7 float noise), and `check_motion_target_alignment.py --clip` passes on the regenerated clip. One env caveat found and documented: GVHMR's YOLO load needs `TORCH_FORCE_NO_WEIGHTS_ONLY_LOAD=1` under torch 2.7 (see `docs/operations/setup_environments.md`).
- 2026-07-04: `motion.clip_switch_prob` (default 0.0, try 0.002) adds deploy-parity MID-swing clip
  switches through the existing wrap-resample path: per-step random abort to a different clip's
  frame 0 + fresh pre-swing hold + fresh target, robot untouched. Parity for
  `pp_reference_clock.hpp`, which flips `clip_id` at arbitrary tts when the planner re-sides the
  target — the root cause of the venue falls at 准备/正手/反手 switches. A8 post-swing capture
  stays wrap-only (aborted swings are not captured). Mech-verified via `clip_switch_count`.
- 2026-07-04: P2.4 `base_decel` reward landed default-off (`rewards.base_decel_weight: 0.0`;
  PACE-style pre-strike pseudo-speed tracking on racket→target planar distance — formula and v2
  plan in `docs/operations/run_training.md` Reward Shaping and `docs/motion_and_contract_v3.md`
  §5). Mech-verified on/off. Same commit hardened `scripts/train.py`: `task.motion`/`task.racket`
  yaml keys go through explicit whitelists and unknown keys RAISE — new yaml keys must extend the
  whitelist in the same commit (the 018467a startup-crash lesson).
- 2026-07-04 (evening): `motion.speed_scale_range` (R14 retiming) landed default-off — per-swing
  reference playback speed with the full consistency cascade (clock ×s via float shadow clock,
  reference velocities ×s, tts ÷s, racket velocity target ×s incl. HER clamp box); train-only
  (play/eval force `[1.0, 1.0]`); flag docs in `docs/operations/run_training.md`, design in
  `docs/motion_and_contract_v3.md` §2. MECH-VERIFIED on pod (2026-07-04 late): OFF run 25 it
  clean; ON run `[0.8,1.2]` 25 it clean with `Live/motion/playback_speed` per-iter env-mean
  fluctuating 0.981-1.012 — the U(0.8,1.2)/√512 signature (a dead flag would sit at 1.0000).
  Arm R14 is launch-ready.
- 2026-07-04 (late): `rewards.free_wrist_ori_mimic` (R16, franco's wrist idea) landed default-off
  and MECH-VERIFIED on pod (25 it clean; startup override log shows both
  `motion_body_ori.body_names-=right_wrist_yaw_Link` and `motion_body_ang_vel.body_names-=...`).
  Config-level: this codebase has no joint-level mimic rewards — body-level orientation tracking
  on the racket-mount link IS the face mimic; the flag filters it out of the two orientation
  terms while keeping position/linear-velocity mimic (swing path). Face is then shaped by
  `racket_normal` / ball-outcome rewards; at contract v3 the freed wrist becomes the actuator of
  the commanded-normal channel.
- 2026-07-04 (evening): v5 clips processed end-to-end ON the pod (`v5_pipeline.sh`, reusing the
  oblique pipeline + `csv_to_npz_mujoco.py`): `/workspace/shared/motions/hope_{forehand,backhand}_v5.npz`
  (56/58 frames @50 Hz, yaw re-grounded +86.6°/+83.6°→0, strike phases [0.768, 0.345]). Data
  flag: the forehand's strike velocity AND face normal are +Y-dominant after re-grounding
  (sideways swing) — unlike oblique/hopex forehands; eyeball review queued before deploy use.

Done (2026-06-26 — first loop reproduced in this harness):

- The Isaac WBC training loop now runs end-to-end on this machine. Run: task `TrackingFlat`, `num_envs=1024`, `max_iterations=60`, `algo.runner.save_interval=25`, `logger=tensorboard`, `run_name=stand_bootstrap`. Mean reward improved monotonically `-4.08 -> -0.24`. Artifacts under `hope_training/whole_body_tracking/logs/rsl_rl/agibot_a3_flat/2026-06-26_13-13-07_stand_bootstrap/`: checkpoints `model_0.pt`, `model_25.pt`, `model_50.pt`, `model_59.pt`, and `exported/policy.onnx` (exported via `scripts/play.py task=TrackingFlat ... checkpoint=model_59.pt motion_file=../motions/a3_stand.npz`). These prove pipeline viability only; the reference clip is a static stand, not a swing.
- Two blockers were resolved to get here, beyond EULA acceptance:
  1. **Blackwell GPU incompatibility (the real blocker).** The RTX 5090 is sm_120; Isaac Sim 4.5.0's bundled `torch 2.5.1+cu124` has no sm_120 kernels and a real CUDA matmul fails with `no kernel image is available for execution on the device`. Fixed by upgrading `hope-isaac-py310` to `torch 2.7.0+cu128` / `torchvision 0.22.0+cu128` and pinning `numpy==1.26.4` (Isaac needs `numpy<2`). Rollback: `pip install torch==2.5.1+cu124 torchvision==0.20.1+cu124 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124`. `isaaclab*` keep a `torch==2.5.1` pin in metadata but are editable installs imported at runtime, so the upgrade does not break them.
  2. **WandB-only motion loading.** `scripts/train.py` fetched the motion clip only from the WandB registry. Added a local `motion_file=` override (skips WandB, mirrors `play.py`) and `motion_file: null` in `cfg/train.yaml`.
- EULA accepted non-interactively via `OMNI_KIT_ACCEPT_EULA=YES`.
- Bootstrap motion: `scripts/make_static_motion.py` generates `hope_training/motions/a3_stand.npz` (static default-pose clip, `fps=50`, `joint_pos[600,31]`, `body_pos_w[600,32,3]`) so the loop runs without the GMR/GVHMR pipeline or WandB. Placeholder reference only.

Not done:

- No accepted quality baseline is set yet; the recorded local and WandB smoke runs and the bounded `wuj6ds9u` verification run prove pipeline viability, not policy strength.
- The verified WandB smoke used only 32 envs for 1 PPO iteration and used later-rejected +Y-facing registry motions; no long unified policy training run or post-train evaluation has been accepted.
- The post-merge unified uniform-target configuration has not been run in Isaac yet; the 2026-07-02 verification runs used this branch's pre-merge `reference_perturbed` defaults, so the unified HOPEPingPong path still needs a fresh run before it can count toward a baseline.
- Uniform reachable target ranges, reward tuning, exact-strike pass rates, stable recovery metrics, and first usable baseline thresholds still need formal acceptance.
- Exact accepted run IDs, checkpoint paths, ONNX paths, and first quality metrics still need to be recorded in this gate for an accepted run.
- The corrected `_hopex.npz` motion clips are ignored local artifacts; new machines must restore or regenerate them through `setup_local_sync.md` before reproducing the recorded local-clip `HOPEPingPong*` training runs.

## Current Verification Commands

Account-free reproduction (no WandB, no motion data — the 2026-06-26 path). On a Blackwell GPU apply the
torch-cu128 fix first (see [run_training.md](../operations/run_training.md#blackwell-rtx-50-series-sm_120-torch-fix)):

```bash
export OMNI_KIT_ACCEPT_EULA=YES
hope_isaac_py scripts/make_static_motion.py --robot agibot_a3 \
  --output_file ../motions/a3_stand.npz --frames 600 --fps 50
hope_isaac_py scripts/train.py task=TrackingFlat algo=ppo headless=true \
  num_envs=1024 max_iterations=60 algo.runner.save_interval=25 \
  logger=tensorboard run_name=stand_bootstrap \
  motion_file=$(pwd)/../motions/a3_stand.npz
```

GPU/Isaac environment, after `source setup_train_env.sh` and restoring/generating Step 9-12 local motions:

```bash
hope_isaac_py scripts/train.py task=TrackingFlat algo=ppo headless=true \
  motion_file=../motions/preprocessed/hope_forehand.npz \
  num_envs=32 max_iterations=3 logger=tensorboard run_name=smoke

hope_isaac_py scripts/train.py task=HOPEPingPong algo=ppo headless=true \
  motion_file=../motions/preprocessed/hope_forehand.npz \
  motion_file_2=../motions/preprocessed/hope_backhand.npz \
  num_envs=32 max_iterations=3 logger=tensorboard run_name=hope_smoke
```

Note: if the local Step 9-12 clips predate the 2026-07-02 HOPE +X alignment fix in `csv_to_npz.py`, use the
corrected `hope_forehand_hopex.npz` / `hope_backhand_hopex.npz` clips (or regenerate);
`scripts/check_motion_target_alignment.py --clip <npz>` verifies alignment without Isaac.

Record the startup lines from `scripts/train.py` showing source provenance and applied overrides. For
an accepted run, also record the registry artifact or local `motion_file`, WandB run ID when logging to
WandB, checkpoint path, exported ONNX path, and exact-strike pass metrics.

### Local Harness Check 2026-06-25

Commands run from the repo root:

```bash
command -v conda
command -v distrobox
command -v docker
nvidia-smi
python3 hope_training/whole_body_tracking/tests/test_table_tennis_geometry.py
bash -lc 'cd hope_training/whole_body_tracking && source setup_train_env.sh && hope_isaac_py -c "import hydra, omegaconf; print(hydra.__version__)"'
```

Results: the ignored A3 Isaac asset was restored locally from tracked Agibot materials and checked for
mesh references (`86` references, `0` missing). The host table-tennis geometry test passed (`6/6`;
torch aerodynamics skipped because host torch is unavailable). Later checks created `grasping` from
`docker.io/nvidia/cuda:12.4.1-cudnn-devel-ubuntu22.04` and verified it sees the RTX 5090 and `nvcc`.
`external_repos/IsaacLab` was cloned at tag `v2.1.0` / commit `21f7136`, and the local
`hope-isaac-py310` env now imports `torch 2.5.1+cu124`, `hydra 1.3.3`, `onnx 1.16.1`, and
`onnxscript 0.3.2` from inside `grasping`. `pip check` reports no broken requirements. Importing
Isaac/Kit reaches the NVIDIA Omniverse EULA prompt; no Isaac smoke test was run before explicit EULA
acceptance.

Additional local motion-environment checks from 2026-06-25:

```bash
cd hope_training/GMR
PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 /home/agiuser/miniconda3/bin/conda run --no-capture-output \
  -n hope-motion-py310 python -c "import general_motion_retargeting, mujoco, smplx, torch"
```

Result: GMR commit `bb1bbe4` imports in `hope-motion-py310` with `torch 2.12.1+cu130` and
`mujoco 3.10.0`. GVHMR commit `6ec3ca3` is cloned but not installed because its requirements pin
CUDA 12.1-era `torch==2.3.0+cu121`/`pytorch3d` wheels that are not accepted for this RTX 5090 host
without a compatibility pass.

## Risks

- Training may fail before policy quality can be evaluated because of asset, observation, or reset issues.
- A weak first policy is still useful, but only if metrics and failure modes are recorded.
- Copying HITTER reward assumptions blindly may hide A3-specific limitations.
- TTRL can change upstream; record the source commit if it informs a training change.

## Next Steps

1. Re-run the unified `HOPEPingPong` smoke and then the real unified forehand+backhand training run under the post-merge uniform-target defaults, from the corrected local `_hopex.npz` clips (`motion_file=`/`motion_file_2=`) or after uploading corrected v5+ registry artifacts and recording their aliases.
2. Set measurable acceptance metrics for first usable baseline: fall rate, racket error at strike, physical recovery after clip wrap, and command latency assumptions.
3. Record exact local motion paths or registry artifacts, WandB run IDs when used, checkpoint paths, and ONNX export paths; evaluate the trained checkpoint/ONNX from the W&B run and record exact quality metrics and failure modes here.
4. Watch the exact-strike pass rates (`strike_pos/vel/normal_pass_exact`, `strike_composite_success_exact`) during long training under the uniform default; if a run opts into `target_mode=reference_perturbed`, also watch `ref_perturb_scale`, since that mode widens the target distribution only through its success-gated curriculum.
5. Run `scripts/sync_external_repos.sh` before using TTRL for comparison, and record the source commit for any extracted idea or config.
