# G05 Isaac Training First Loop

Status: Partial

## Goal

Run the first end-to-end Isaac training loop that produces a policy artifact, even if the policy is weak.

This gate should prove that the training stack can consume A3 assets and produce a deployable policy format.

## Inputs

- Isaac-ready A3 asset from G04.
- Motion references or placeholder task references.
- BeyondMimic/whole-body tracking scaffold.
- Policy observation/action contract.

## Outputs

- First accepted training run.
- Training config.
- Logs and metrics.
- Exported policy artifact path or metadata.
- Initial policy evaluation notes.

## Related Directories

- `hope_training/whole_body_tracking`
- `docs/interfaces/policy_observation_action.md`
- `docs/operations/run_training.md`
- `vendor_assets/` for generated heavy policy artifacts if needed
- `external_repos/TTRL-ICRA2026` as an auto-synced reference if first-loop failures need comparison

## Operation Docs

- [../operations/run_training.md](../operations/run_training.md)
- [../operations/setup_local_sync.md](../operations/setup_local_sync.md)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Isaac environment starts with the A3 asset.
- A random rollout works.
- A first PPO or equivalent training loop runs.
- Policy export path is documented.
- First-loop results are recorded, even if poor.

## Current State

Done:

- Training scaffold is present under `hope_training/whole_body_tracking`.
- Existing docs describe BeyondMimic-style training assumptions.
- The branch adds Hydra training/eval entrypoints, HOPEPingPong task config, racket-target command logic, and A3-specific robot config.
- `reimplement.md` records that `TrackingFlat` and `HOPEPingPong` forehand training have run end-to-end on the copied A3 URDF asset, including wandb logging, checkpoint save, and `policy.onnx` export.
- Commit `42489cd` adds `setup_train_env.sh`, richer WandB/live metrics, and in-container ONNX export support.
- Commit `c951d9d` is integrated here: `HOPEPingPong` now defaults to `target_mode: reference_perturbed`, which samples racket targets around the reference motion's strike-frame racket pose/velocity/normal with a curriculum perturbation. This keeps the first RL target distribution reachable by construction while preserving the legacy uniform box as an explicit placeholder mode.
- Latest `origin/train_1` training updates are integrated here: `HOPEPingPong.yaml` now uses the PATH B/C slower-hit defaults (`racket_position_weight: 8`, `racket_position_std: 0.15`, `racket_velocity_weight: 4`, `racket_velocity_std: 1.2`, `racket_normal_weight: 3`, `base_position_weight: 4`, `motion_scale: 0.30`), shrinks reference perturbations to `[0.06, 0.08, 0.06]` position and `[0.3, 0.3, 0.25]` velocity, narrows the strike reward window to `0.12 s`, and sets `ref_vel_scale: 0.6` to train a controllable 3-4 m/s hit before returning to the full-speed reference.
- `RacketTargetCommand` now logs conditional exact-strike pass rates: `strike_pos_pass_exact`, `strike_vel_pass_exact`, `strike_normal_pass_exact`, `strike_composite_success_exact`, and `exact_strike_sample_count_decayed`. The success-gated perturbation curriculum advances from these exact-strike rates, not from diluted episode-wide errors.
- `RacketTargetCommand` also supports optional debug reward logging (`debug_reward_logging`) for swing-through sign checks and raw-vs-gated reward kernels. Keep it off for production runs unless diagnosing reward scale.
- The HOPE actor observation now includes desired `racket_target_normal_w`; actual racket pose/velocity/normal remains critic/reward-only simulation state.
- `scripts/train.py` logs import provenance, env-cfg source, every applied task override, and post-override racket knobs; YAML keys that target missing env-cfg attributes raise instead of silently no-oping.
- Generated ONNX policy artifacts remain ignored by asset policy unless a gate records an external artifact path.

Done (2026-06-26 — first loop reproduced in this harness):

- The Isaac WBC training loop now runs end-to-end on this machine. Run: task `TrackingFlat`, `num_envs=1024`, `max_iterations=60`, `algo.runner.save_interval=25`, `logger=tensorboard`, `run_name=stand_bootstrap`. Mean reward improved monotonically `-4.08 -> -0.24`. Artifacts under `hope_training/whole_body_tracking/logs/rsl_rl/agibot_a3_flat/2026-06-26_13-13-07_stand_bootstrap/`: checkpoints `model_0.pt`, `model_25.pt`, `model_50.pt`, `model_59.pt`, and `exported/policy.onnx` (exported via `scripts/play.py task=TrackingFlat ... checkpoint=model_59.pt motion_file=../motions/a3_stand.npz`). These prove pipeline viability only; the reference clip is a static stand, not a swing.
- Two blockers were resolved to get here, beyond EULA acceptance:
  1. **Blackwell GPU incompatibility (the real blocker).** The RTX 5090 is sm_120; Isaac Sim 4.5.0's bundled `torch 2.5.1+cu124` has no sm_120 kernels and a real CUDA matmul fails with `no kernel image is available for execution on the device`. Fixed by upgrading `hope-isaac-py310` to `torch 2.7.0+cu128` / `torchvision 0.22.0+cu128` and pinning `numpy==1.26.4` (Isaac needs `numpy<2`). Rollback: `pip install torch==2.5.1+cu124 torchvision==0.20.1+cu124 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124`. `isaaclab*` keep a `torch==2.5.1` pin in metadata but are editable installs imported at runtime, so the upgrade does not break them.
  2. **WandB-only motion loading.** `scripts/train.py` fetched the motion clip only from the WandB registry. Added a local `motion_file=` override (skips WandB, mirrors `play.py`) and `motion_file: null` in `cfg/train.yaml`.
- EULA accepted non-interactively via `OMNI_KIT_ACCEPT_EULA=YES`.
- Bootstrap motion: `scripts/make_static_motion.py` generates `hope_training/motions/a3_stand.npz` (static default-pose clip, `fps=50`, `joint_pos[600,31]`, `body_pos_w[600,32,3]`) so the loop runs without the GMR/GVHMR pipeline or WandB. Placeholder reference only.

Not done:

- No accepted quality baseline is set yet; the recorded first loop proves pipeline viability, not policy strength. The reference is a synthetic static stand — a real forehand/backhand requires the GMR/GVHMR retargeting pipeline (raw videos + license-gated SMPL-X/GVHMR checkpoints) or motions from a WandB registry. `train.py` now supports either path (`motion_file=` local or `registry_name=` WandB).
- Forehand/backhand reference availability, reference-perturbation ranges, optional uniform reachable target ranges, reward tuning, exact-strike pass rates, and stable recovery metrics still need formal acceptance.
- Exact accepted run IDs, checkpoint paths, ONNX paths, and first quality metrics still need to be recorded in this gate.

## Current Verification Commands

Account-free reproduction (no WandB, no motion data — the 2026-06-26 path). On a Blackwell GPU apply the
torch-cu128 fix first (see [run_training.md](../operations/run_training.md#blackwell-rtx-50-series-sm_120-torch-fix)):

```bash
export OMNI_KIT_ACCEPT_EULA=YES
hope_isaac_py scripts/make_static_motion.py --robot agibot_a3 \
  --output_file ../motions/a3_stand.npz --frames 600 --fps 50
hope_isaac_py scripts/train.py task=TrackingFlat algo=ppo headless=true \
  num_envs=1024 max_iterations=60 algo.runner.save_interval=25 \
  logger=tensorboard run_name=stand_bootstrap \
  motion_file=$(pwd)/../motions/a3_stand.npz
```

GPU/Isaac environment, after `source setup_train_env.sh` (WandB-registry path):

```bash
hope_isaac_py scripts/train.py task=TrackingFlat algo=ppo headless=true \
  num_envs=32 max_iterations=3 logger=tensorboard run_name=smoke

hope_isaac_py scripts/train.py task=HOPEPingPong algo=ppo headless=true \
  registry_name="$WANDB_REGISTRY_ORG/wandb-registry-motions/hope_forehand" \
  num_envs=32 max_iterations=3 logger=tensorboard run_name=hope_smoke
```

Record the startup lines from `scripts/train.py` showing source provenance and applied overrides. For
an accepted run, also record the WandB run ID, checkpoint path, exported ONNX path, and exact-strike
pass metrics.

### Local Harness Check 2026-06-25

Commands run from the repo root:

```bash
command -v conda
command -v distrobox
command -v docker
nvidia-smi
python3 hope_training/whole_body_tracking/tests/test_table_tennis_geometry.py
bash -lc 'cd hope_training/whole_body_tracking && source setup_train_env.sh && hope_isaac_py -c "import hydra, omegaconf; print(hydra.__version__)"'
```

Results: the ignored A3 Isaac asset was restored locally from tracked Agibot materials and checked for
mesh references (`86` references, `0` missing). The host table-tennis geometry test passed (`6/6`;
torch aerodynamics skipped because host torch is unavailable). Later checks created `grasping` from
`docker.io/nvidia/cuda:12.4.1-cudnn-devel-ubuntu22.04` and verified it sees the RTX 5090 and `nvcc`.
`external_repos/IsaacLab` was cloned at tag `v2.1.0` / commit `21f7136`, and the local
`hope-isaac-py310` env now imports `torch 2.5.1+cu124`, `hydra 1.3.3`, `onnx 1.16.1`, and
`onnxscript 0.3.2` from inside `grasping`. `pip check` reports no broken requirements. Importing
Isaac/Kit reaches the NVIDIA Omniverse EULA prompt; no Isaac smoke test was run before explicit EULA
acceptance.

Additional local motion-environment checks from 2026-06-25:

```bash
cd hope_training/GMR
PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 /home/agiuser/miniconda3/bin/conda run --no-capture-output \
  -n hope-motion-py310 python -c "import general_motion_retargeting, mujoco, smplx, torch"
```

Result: GMR commit `bb1bbe4` imports in `hope-motion-py310` with `torch 2.12.1+cu130` and
`mujoco 3.10.0`. GVHMR commit `6ec3ca3` is cloned but not installed because its requirements pin
CUDA 12.1-era `torch==2.3.0+cu121`/`pytorch3d` wheels that are not accepted for this RTX 5090 host
without a compatibility pass.

## Risks

- Training may fail before policy quality can be evaluated because of asset, observation, or reset issues.
- A weak first policy is still useful, but only if metrics and failure modes are recorded.
- Copying HITTER reward assumptions blindly may hide A3-specific limitations.
- TTRL can change upstream; record the source commit if it informs a training change.

## Next Steps

1. Record exact wandb run IDs, checkpoint paths, and ONNX export paths for the first successful runs.
2. Set measurable acceptance metrics for first usable baseline: fall rate, racket error at strike, recovery, and command latency assumptions.
3. Train and evaluate both forehand and backhand references with `target_mode: reference_perturbed`, then compare against legacy uniform sampling only after reachable ranges are measured.
4. Run `scripts/sync_external_repos.sh` before using TTRL for comparison, and record the source commit for any extracted idea or config.
